# 同理回顧介紹要點
重新回顧了幾篇同理相關文獻，發覺有一些觀念可能需要進行修正

1. cognitive, affective, behavioral empathy的定義也隨著不同的研究者有所不同， 要用哪一個需要討論與定調
2. 目前的結果需要重新檢視以和定調的定義相符
3. empathy dimensions的分類同樣也有不同的見解，為何要使用目前的分類需要說明

Cognitive empathy is the ability to understand another’s feelings, related closely to theory of mind (Blair, 2005).
Affective empathy is concerned with the experience of emotion, elicited by an emotional stimulus.

Hall-2021-What is clinical empathy
- 本研究利用問卷調查了四個不同族群，詢問他們心目前一個有同理心的醫師應該符合什麼樣子的描述。再用主成份分析法抽取醫師同理心表現應該要有的樣子，結果包含了
	- Conscientious and Reassuring
	- Relationship Oriented
	- Emotionally Involved
	- Not Assigned to a Factor
- subgroup CFA的分析結果顯示，這四個因素在不同的參與者內都是符合的
- 變異數分析的結果顯示，在Emotionally Involved，不同族群的樣本得分有所不同，特別是Physicians and patients 這兩組人。病人組不認為需要有高程度的情緒涉入，但是醫師組認為需要

- Clinical empathy involves an ability to:
  - (a) understand the patient's situation, perspective, and feelings (and their attached meanings);
  - (b) to communicate that understanding and check its accuracy; and
  - (c) to act on that understanding with the patient in a helpful (therapeutic) way.

- ‘the competence of a physician to understand the patient’s situation, perspective, and feelings; to communicate that understanding, and check its accuracy; and to act on that understanding with the patient in a helpful therapeutic way’ (Hermans et al., 2018)

- empathetic process (Williams and Stickley, 2010)
  - emotional engagement
  - cognitive or intelligent stage
  - employment of behavioral skills

Mohammadi et al., 2021
Empathy is the perception of patients’ feelings and experiences, namely, nurses can understand their patients’ feelings by considering themselves in their position. It has both affective and cognitive components (2). Affective Empathy (AE) is the ability to **understand emotional experience of others**, i.e., an appropriate reaction to their affective states while Cognitive Empathy (CE) indicates the ability to understand the **precise mental perspective of others**, letting one to express their mental or emotional states openly (3).
